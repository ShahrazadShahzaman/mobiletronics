# Mobile E-Commerce Website

**Project Title**: Mobile Online Store

**Description**:  
This is a simple, interactive e-commerce website I built using **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**, **Bootstrap**, and **jQuery**. The website allows users to browse products, select different colors, adjust quantities, and add items to their cart. There's also a login form with validation. It’s designed to be mobile-friendly and serves as part of my portfolio to showcase my front-end web development skills.

## Features

- **Product Cards**: View product images, descriptions, and prices, all displayed in neat product cards.
- **Color Selection**: Choose different colors for products. When a user selects a color, the product image changes to match the selected color.
- **Quantity Control**: Increase or decrease the quantity of items you want to buy directly from the product card.
- **Add to Cart**: Add products to your cart, and a pop-up will show the updated quantity and total price.
- **Cart Icon**: The cart icon updates to show how many items you've added to the cart.
- **Login Form with Validation**: A basic login form that validates email and password fields to ensure correct input.
- **Responsive Design**: The app is fully responsive, meaning it looks great on both desktop and mobile devices thanks to **Bootstrap**.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Used to structure the web pages.
- **CSS**: Used to style the product cards and page layout.
- **JavaScript**: Adds interactivity, like color changes, quantity adjustments, and cart functionality.
- **jQuery**: Helps with the form validation etc.
- **Bootstrap**: Makes the site mobile-friendly and gives it a polished, responsive design.
